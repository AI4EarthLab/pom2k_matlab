                                POMVIZ PACKAGE

                        List of Matlab/netCDF functions

              (To be used to process netCDF files output by pom2k)

The full POMVIZ package is provided in either the "zip" file pomviz.zip or
the "tar" file pomviz.tar.

The package requires Charles Denham's netCDF Toolbox for Matlab-5/6, available 
from:
